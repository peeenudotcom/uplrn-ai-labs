### Matching Algorithm

```
For each archetype:
  score = 0
  
  For each user interest that matches archetype.triggers.interests:
    score += 25
  
  If user personality === archetype.triggers.personality:
    score += 30
  
  For each user goal that matches archetype.triggers.goals:
    score += 15
  
  // Context bonus (from branched Step 2)
  If user is professional + archetype involves business/consulting:
    score += 10
  If user is student + archetype involves learning/creativity:
    score += 10
  If user is business owner + archetype involves automation/operations:
    score += 10

Sort by score descending. Return top 3.
Add slight random variance (±3) so retakes feel fresh.
```
